## Configuration Setup

- Copy the `config.example.yaml` file.

## Start the Provider Broker

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

The provider broker has an automatic settlement engine that ensures you can collect fees promptly before your customer's account balance is insufficient, while also minimizing the frequency of charges to reduce gas consumption.
