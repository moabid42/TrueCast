# TrueCase
TrueCase is a decentralized platform for trustworthy, transparent journalism. It aims to restore faith in news by empowering a global community to share and verify information openly.


## Project requirements
We want to create a decentralized news plattform where we will have the following features :
- We have 2 types of users, normal users and the journalists.
- The journalists can stack tokens upon publishing articles, they will either lose these tokens depending on the quality of the publications.
- The quality is defined by popularity of the article, and its truthfulness (AI and voting system).
- The journalist can also stake tokens, when accessing the quality of other articles.
- Our principle is built upon there is more good people in the world than bad people, which means the upvote is high it means it should be trusted.
- We will use the AI to verify the facts, it should split the article written into 2 parts the fact and the writer opinion (naturel level processing) and it will give a score to the article based on that if the score is too low the article should be ignored 
- We will use the AI to tokenize the article the article and ultimately score the article
- This score will be used as a brief about he truthness of the article
- We will use self protocol to verify the identities of the journalists
- We will use 0G on top of Fluence for AI deployement
- We will use Walrus to store all the articles and media contents
